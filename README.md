# Meme-Scrapper
🕷️ Multi-Platform Meme Scraper

A powerful, automated web scraping tool built with Googles's Antigravity designed to aggregate meme content from the web's most popular social platforms based on user-defined keywords.
📝 What the project does

This application serves as a centralized search engine for memes. Instead of manually browsing through different apps, this tool automates the process by connecting to Reddit, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Pinterest.

When a user inputs a keyword (e.g., "coding", "cats", "marvel"), the scraper:

    Navigates to the specified platforms.

    Searches for the keyword in relevant hashtags, subreddits, or feeds.

    Extracts image and video URLs associated with the meme.

    Downloads or Displays the content in a unified interface.

💡 Why the project is useful

    Content Aggregation: It saves time for content creators, meme page admins, and marketing teams by pulling trending content from multiple sources into one place.

    Dataset Collection: It is highly useful for developers and researchers building AI models who need large datasets of memes for image classification or sentiment analysis.

    Trend Analysis: It allows users to see how a specific topic is being meme-fied across different social cultures (e.g., how Reddit humor differs from Instagram humor on the same topic).

    Entertainment: It provides an endless, curated feed of humor specific to exactly what the user wants to see, filtering out the noise of general social media feeds.
